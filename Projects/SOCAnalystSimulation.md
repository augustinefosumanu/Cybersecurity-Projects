# Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the role of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst for Virtual Space Industries (VSI), a company developing virtual-reality programs. As an SOC analyst, I am responsible for detecting and analyzing potential cyberattacks—particularly from a known competitor, JobeCorp—using Splunk as the central monitoring and analysis tool. </br>

### Walkthrough

#### Upload Windows Server Logs to Splunk
I selected “Add Data” in Splunk, chose the “Upload” method, and selected the windows_server_logs.csv file from the /splunk/logs/Week-2-Day-3-Logs/ directory. Without changing the source type settings, I clicked “Next,” updated the “Host” field to “Windows_server_logs,” and reviewed the settings. After submitting, I saw a success message and clicked “Start Searching” to begin analyzing the data. </br>
