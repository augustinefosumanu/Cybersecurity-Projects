[Projects](https://github.com/augustinefosumanu/UT-Austin-Bootcamp-Hands-On-Projects/tree/main/Projects)
  - [Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst Simulation](https://github.com/augustinefosumanu/UT-Austin-Bootcamp-Hands-On-Projects/blob/main/Projects/SOCAnalystSimulation.md)
    - **Summary**
      - I deployed and configured **Splunk** to ingest, analyze, and correlate logs from **Windows and Apache servers**, enabling real-time detection of cyber threats. </br>  
      - I designed **interactive dashboards** and **custom alerts** to monitor suspicious activity, supporting early identification of a **simulated cyberattack** by an external adversary. </br>
      - I conducted **forensic log analysis** and delivered a **comprehensive security report** and **executive-level presentation** outlining attack vectors and mitigation strategies. </br>
      
  - [Linux Hardening & Automation](https://github.com/augustinefosumanu/UT-Austin-Bootcamp-Hands-On-Projects/blob/main/Projects/LinuxHardening%26AutomationProject.md)
    - **Summary**
      - I implemented Linux security hardening measures, **reducing potential attack surface by 30%** by configuring password policies for **5+ user accounts** and restricting unnecessary services. </br>
      - I automated system backup and restoration procedures using Cron jobs, **decreasing recovery time by 50%** and ensuring data integrity for critical system files. </br>
      - I enhanced user access management by implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and reducing the number if users with sudo privileges, minimizing the risk of insider threats. </br>

    
  - [Ethical Keylogger Project](https://github.com/augustinefosumanu/UT-Austin-Bootcamp-Hands-On-Projects/blob/main/Projects/EthicalKeylogger.md)
    - **Summary**
      - Developed a keylogging tool using the pynput library to capture keystrokes, handling both alphanumeric characters and special keys (e.g., Space, Enter, Shift, Control) for robust event tracking. </br>
      - Implemented error handling for key presses that don't have a char attribute, ensuring seamless logging of special keys and control sequences to a text file (key_log.txt). </br>
      - Created a persistent keylogger listener that runs in the background and continuously monitors and logs keyboard inputs, allowing for real-time capture of user activity. </br>
  
  - [Web Application & Windows/Linux Server Vulnerabilities - CTF](https://github.com/augustinefosumanu/UT-Austin-Bootcamp-Hands-On-Projects/blob/main/Projects/WebandServerVulnerabilties-CTF.md)
    - **Summary**
      - I participated in a CTF competition amongst my class **ranking in the top 5% of students** with the most solved problems exploiting over **15 web application and server vulnerabilities** and capturing the flags within a time-constrained environment. </br>  
      - I identified and exploited **7+ vulnerabilities** including **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Command Injection** in a web application environment demonstrating the ability to reduce potential attack vectors. </br>
      - I successfully penetrated and gained **root access** to **1 simulated Linux server** and **2 computers on a Windows Server**, highlighting skills in identifying critical vulnerabilities and **assessing the potential impact of privilege escalation attacks**. </br>
