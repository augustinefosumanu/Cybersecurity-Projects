  - [Linux Hardening & Automation](https://github.com/augustinefosumanu/UT-Austin-Bootcamp-Hands-On-Projects/blob/main/Projects/LinuxHardening%26AutomationProject.md)
    - **Summary**
      - I implemented Linux security hardening measures, **reducing potential attack surface by 30%** by configuring password policies for **5+ user accounts** and restricting unnecessary services. </br>
      - I automated system backup and restoration procedures using Cron jobs, **decreasing recovery time by 50%** and ensuring data integrity for critical system files. </br>
      - I enhanced user access management by implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and reducing the number if users with sudo privileges, minimizing the risk of insider threats. </br>
  
  - [Web Application & Windows/Linux Server Vulnerabilities - CTF](https://github.com/augustinefosumanu/UT-Austin-Bootcamp-Hands-On-Projects/blob/main/Projects/WebandServerVulnerabilties-CTF.md)
    - **Summary**
      - I participated in a CTF competition amongst my class **ranking in the top 5% of students** with the most solved problems exploiting over **15 web application and server vulnerabilities** and capturing the flags within a time-constrained environment. </br>  
      - I identified and exploited **7+ vulnerabilities** including **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Command Injection** in a web application environment demonstrating the ability to reduce potential attack vectors. </br>
      - I successfully penetrated and gained **root access** to **1 simulated Linux server** and **2 computers on a Windows Server**, highlighting skills in identifying critical vulnerabilities and **assessing the potential impact of privilege escalation attacks**. </br>
